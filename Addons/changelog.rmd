> massive overhaul of the heli taxi system
> helis and their owners are now created and handled on & by the server
> you can set waypoints to reach the destination
> all members of the group that called the heli are now able to cancel it and set its course while inside
> you can change the course of the heli midflight and give it new waypoints at any time (except if the heli is in its landing phase.
> you can choose LZs over water and MOST helis will safely hover over the water. (be careful some bigger helis will sink)
> If you are in the water and the helicopter is coming to pick you up, since you are too far for classic arma action, helis will receive an ACE3 “climb in” interaction allowing you to move inside from the water.
> compatibility with some helis that do not land completely (RHS super stallion)
>Sometimes helis do not land, in that case passengers will receive an ace3 action to force the landing after 3 seconds
